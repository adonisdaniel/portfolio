    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>
      When I first started out in programming, I fell in love with <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I
      was so interested in learning everything I could about it to become a
      skilled web developer. I really enjoy building things "by hand," but I'm
      also comfortable using styling libraries like Bootstrap. My first big goal
      was to get a solid handle on JavaScript's fundamentals, knowing that a
      strong base would set me up for success with <strong>React.js</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few years later, I picked up <strong>Vue</strong>, and now it's the framework I use most
      often. I've also expanded my skills to the backend, working with
      <strong>Adonis.js</strong>, a Node-based framework that feels similar to Laravel. For save data I
      typically use <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Postgres</strong>.
