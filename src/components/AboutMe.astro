    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>
      I began my development journey specializing in <strong>JavaScript</strong
      >, diving deep into its ecosystem to master modern web development. I'm
      passionate about building interfaces from the ground up, preferring
      hands-on coding over pre-built component libraries—though I'm well-versed
      in frameworks like
      <strong>Bootstrap</strong> when the project demands it. My foundation in vanilla
      JavaScript has proven invaluable for creating efficient, maintainable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I work primarily with <strong>Vue.js</strong> for frontend development,
      complemented by <strong>AdonisJS</strong>—a Laravel-inspired Node.js
      framework—for backend architecture. My stack includes <strong
        >MongoDB</strong
      > for database management, and I'm experienced in building RESTful APIs, real-time
      features with WebSockets, and scalable application architectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond JavaScript, I have working knowledge of <strong>C#</strong> for building
      backend services and console applications, allowing me to adapt to diverse
      technical environments and collaborate effectively across different tech stacks.
